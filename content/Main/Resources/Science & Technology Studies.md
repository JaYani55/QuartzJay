# Definition

## Simple

Science and Technology Studies, or STS for short, is like studying how science and all the gadgets and inventions we use are part of our world. Imagine looking at your smartphone and asking, "How did this get made? Who decided what it should do? How does it affect my life and the world around me?" STS tries to answer these questions. It's like being a detective, but instead of solving crimes, you're figuring out how science and technology fit into our lives. You look at how people make, use, and think about things like computers, bridges, or even medicine, and you see how all of this is connected to the way we live, our rules, and our planet.

Science and Technology Studies (STS) emerges as a field deeply enmeshed within the fabric of societal dynamics, interrogating the entanglements of scientific knowledge, technological innovation, and socio-cultural structures. This discipline, rooted in the historical and philosophical analysis of science and technology, unfolds from the recognition that technological and scientific developments are not isolated phenomena but are deeply integrated within and influenced by the societal context in which they arise. The foundational work of Thomas Kuhn, particularly through "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions," underscored the paradigmatic shifts in scientific thought as not merely intellectual revolutions but as processes deeply embedded in societal changes and intellectual contexts​​.

Moreover, STS is characterized by its interdisciplinary nature, drawing upon a diverse array of disciplines including anthropology, history, political science, and sociology, to forge a comprehensive understanding of the ways in which science and technology shape and are shaped by societal norms, values, and power dynamics. The field has evolved through various phases, including a significant "turn to technology" in the mid-1980s, where the focus expanded to include not just the social construction of scientific knowledge but also the technological artifacts themselves, their development, and their integration into society​​.

Prominent scholars such as Trevor Pinch, Wiebe Bijker, and later on, figures like Bruno Latour, Sheila Jasanoff, and Judy Wajcman, have significantly contributed to the breadth and depth of STS, exploring the social construction of technology, the interaction between technology and gender, and the complex dynamics of technological systems within the fabric of society. Their work underscores the notion that technology is not merely a product of engineering but is co-produced by a variety of social, cultural, and political forces​​.

In contemporary discussions, STS addresses the challenges and opportunities presented by technological advancements, examining the ethical, social, and political dimensions of scientific research and technological innovation. It delves into the implications of these developments for societal well-being, governance, and the environment, thereby serving as a critical lens through which the intertwined nature of science, technology, and society can be understood and interrogated.
