# Abstract

## Simplified Abstract

This paper takes a close look at how people and technology mix together in the world of Virtual Reality (VR), especially focusing on a virtual place called VRChat. Imagine VR like a digital playground where you can create your own avatar and interact with others in a completely computer-generated world. The study uses ideas from famous thinkers and the author's own experiences in VR to understand how these digital spaces work and what they mean for us as humans.

The main point is to see how VR is not just about cool tech but also about who can or cannot use this tech based on things like money, knowledge, and physical ability. For example, not everyone can afford the best VR equipment, and some people might get dizzy or feel sick in VR. The paper also looks at how people express themselves in VR, like choosing how their avatars look and act, which can sometimes turn into a digital form of showing off or even making money.

However, the paper finds that even in a place where everyone is supposed to be equal because they're all just avatars, real-world problems like not having enough money or being judged by others can still sneak in. So, while VR can be a fun and exciting way to meet people and do things you can't do in real life, it also shows us that we have to think carefully about making these spaces fair and open for everyone.

In short, this paper digs into the complicated relationship between humans and their gadgets in the VR world, showing both the cool possibilities and the challenges we need to work on.

## Academic Abstract

This paper explores the intricate relationship between humans and technology within the realm of Virtual Reality (VR), particularly focusing on VRChat as a social space that exemplifies the cyborg ontology proposed by Donna Haraway and further elaborated through concepts of machinic assemblage by Deleuze and Guattari. By engaging with Actor-Network Theory (ANT) for its methodological framework, the study delves into the socio-material configurations of VR, challenging traditional dichotomies of human/machine and reality/virtuality. The research employs an autoethnographic approach to examine the accessibility of VR technology, revealing systemic inequities embedded in the human-hardware assemblages. Through the lens of sensory anthropology, it investigates how VR as sensory machines shape and are shaped by cultural codings of sensory inputs, highlighting the transformation of perception and interaction within digital environments.

The paper critically analyzes the socioeconomic barriers to VR engagement, emphasizing the role of hardware configurations, bodily acclimatization to VR spaces, and the nuanced dynamics of digital embodiment. It interrogates the phenomenon of cyborg erotica within VRChat, mapping out how digital bodies become sites of desire, identity expression, and economic activity, thereby complicating notions of digital dualism. The study underscores the paradoxical nature of VR spaces, where the potential for democratization and radical embodiment coexists with new forms of exclusion and inequality.

By situating VRChat within the broader discourse of posthumanism and digital culture, Rathjen's work contributes to a nuanced understanding of the digital as a lived experience. It calls for a more inclusive design and ethical consideration in the development of VR technologies, advocating for a future where digital spaces facilitate not only novel forms of interaction but also equitable access and representation.

# Cyborg Ontology

_"By the late twentieth century, our time, a mythic time, we are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism; in short, we are cyborgs."_ (Haraway, 1991)

In her seminal text, "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century," Donna Haraway proposes the concept of a cyborg ontology to challenge the traditional dichotomies of nature/culture, human/machine, and self/other. A cyborg is a hybrid creature that is part human and part machine, and Haraway argues that this hybridity is the defining characteristic of the posthuman condition.

Haraway's cyborg ontology is based on the idea that the boundaries between these traditional categories are increasingly blurred and permeable. She argues that we are all cyborgs to some extent, as we are all enmeshed in a world of technologies that are constantly transforming our bodies and ourselves.

Yet, the cyborg is not merely a passive victim of transformative disruption brought on by the force of technological development. Crucially, they are also active, creative agents of transforming their selves and surroundings through (re-)appropriating control of technologies and bodies.

André Nusselder (2009) discusses this cyborg ontology in greater detail. Drawing from Lacanian psychoanalysis, Nusselder argues that digital technologies mark a deep shift in the basic functions of reality-making by enabling each individual to - basically - be “everything, everywhere, all at once"[[1]](#_ftn1). Nusselder does away with a false dichotomy of ‘real’ and ‘not-real’, instead asserting that ‘real reality’ is already virtualized by different systems of codification. Computer interfacing then is a process which creates new forms of reality, as digital worlds create conditions for “a reality less bound by the symbolic order – and perhaps more open to the imaginary”[[2]](#_ftn2).

# The Human-Hardware Assemblage

Another central piece to the theoretical background of this paper is the concept of the machinic assemblage (Deleuze/Guattari, 1987). A machinic assemblage refers to a collection of heterogenous components that come together to form an assemblage, or system. Crucially, according to Deleuze and Guattari, the components within a machinic assemblage can be both material and immaterial - technological and ideological. In this view, a human body is a machinic assemblage that is held together by the materiality of its parts, organs and cells as well as the immaterial informational signals that inform it's structure - like DNA - or the signals from the environment that enter a body through the sensory organs. Following the logic of the machinic assemblage, systematics of inter-human interactions are similarly made up of material organs - bodies, technologies - as well as immaterial organs - symbols, algorithms, ideologies - that inform and alter patterns of reproducing social meaning-making. I will combine Donna Haraway’s Cyborg and Deleuze’s Machinic Assemblages to suggest the figuration of the human-hardware assemblage to describe the system emerging out of the symbiosis of human and personal computational machine.

Crucially however, there is a lot that can go wrong in such a symbiotic process. Failure, glitch and irregularity is an integral part of interfacing systems. Sweeny (2013) identifies failure and dysfunction as a central part of digital applications, which the concept of the machinic assemblage can capture through an artistic rather than positivistic approach to analysis. In Deleuzian theory, failure and dysfunction is an integral part of any flow of (social) reality, rather than the positivist notion of failure as a stain of uncleanliness in a preconceived utopian ideal.

Drawing upon the concept of the machinic assemblage and cyborg ontology, the method for this paper will additionally deploy the poststructuralist Actor-Network Theory (ANT) by Bruno Latour (2007). ANT stresses the importance of flexibility in outlining a field. each and every component - from the technical artifacts, governing bodies to the everyday inhabitants - a field is mapped as a constantly shifting, rhizomatic schema of connections within ANT, rather than a hierarchical structure where each component has it's fixed place within a preconceived whole. Thus, ANT stresses the importance of maintaining analytical flexibility regarding what molar part of the whole a researcher might view, while at the same time methodologically grounding the approach in an anthropological participatory observation paradigm[[3]](#_ftn3).

While an Actor-Network Mapping would be above the scope of this paper, ANT is an important methodological framework for the analysis of the multiple material and immaterial aspects of VR as a technology and VRChat as a piece of software.

Digital gaming, and VR even more so, is a complex sociomaterial configuration. It cannot be properly analyzed by operating under the assumptions of an essentialist notion of an a priori existing 'human nature', as many anthropological studies of information technology have already asserted that much of what one may consider ‘human nature’ is subject to change through these technologies. In the essentialist notion, digital technologies merely emulate and create representations of a physical world that is phenomenologically superordinated to the 'artificial' digital world. Instead, I will utilize the science fiction figuration of the 'Cyborg' to trace the different components of VR technology / digital technology as cybernetic implants that constitute new forms of corporeality, as they extend the potential capabilities for humans to interact with the world beyond a human bodies physical and temporal presence.

By answering questions of accessibility of social community platforms through VR technology, I am also hoping to contribute to a growing body of new materialist knowledge which challenges preconceived notions of normativity regarding the body and the social. As well as neo-positivist notions of technology as pure 'enhancement' of normative notions where glitch and ontological change constitute mere hurdles to a preconceived continuity of a normative future.

## Accessing sensory machines

Howes (2020) describes Anthropologies conceptualization of it's material basis through multiple 'turns' as epochs of the field. From the linguistic turn to the pictorial turn and the corporeal turn to a more recent and not yet fully defined 'sensory anthropology'. Anthropologists of the senses have asserted that individual perception is informed and altered through cultural coding of sensory inputs. (Classen, 2010).

VR/XR/AR technologies, as well as digital games on a flat screen for that matter, are sensory machines for the production of designed experience and sensory inputs. They promise 'immersion' into a digitally produced experience. 'Immersion' is achieved with the help of human-machine interfacing technologies such as Keyboard & Mouse, Controllers, optics & spatial computing, hand/eye/body tracking, treadmill controls or haptic suits to provide feedback to as many senses of the human body as possible and from the interaction of the user with the designed structure of the game world.

VR technologies are interface technologies that connect the biological sensory apparatus of the human body with the technological sensory apparatus. Interfacing technologies are cybernetic technologies, in the sense that they allow for a multidirectional feedback process. To allow output that is translated into sensory information readable to the biological machine and for the biological machine to input information that is translated into machine language.

The different hardware setups act as material components of the machinic assemblage. Not unlike differently abled and (culturally) configured bodies do hardware assemblages have different capacities to compute the software that runs the virtual world in which the assemblage resides, which in turn alters the experience for each individual assemblage.

_Research Question_

In this study, I want to test these conceptual frameworks and apply them to a research question regarding inequal access regarding VR technology. I want to identify how various components of VR are configured and interacting with other components of an individual such as socioeconomic means, physical/cognitive configuration or the configuration of other hardware. I will do this through an autoethnographic description of the setup process with the virtual reality hardware. Then, I want to explore VRChat as a social game and example of a space in which the human-hardware configuration may move in a social space with other human-hardware configurations. The goal is to identify systematics of inequality that emerge out of VR as a cybernetic technology that forms new body configurations.

## Manufacturing Virtual Reality

Virtual Reality (VR), extended reality (XR), or augmented reality (AR) are all terms for technologies that promise to transform how we perceive and interact with the world. VR immerses users in a completely digital environment, while AR overlays digital elements onto the real world. XR encompasses both these experiences, bridging the gap between the physical and digital realms.

Within the ever-optimistic big tech discourse, there is much hype around these technologies, which I will subsume in the following text simply as VR. The promise is that these technologies have the potential to reshape entertainment, communication, education, and various industries by offering novel ways of experiencing reality through both the hardware, such as VR headsets, and - crucially - the software that provides the platform.

VR promises many things. Revolutionary medical technologies, learning through hands-on experience in simulated environments, journalistic stories that make a viewer feel like they are 'really there' in the spectacle that is the unfolding events of history and, of course, new, and revolutionary means for entertainment and games. This is all wrapped around the all-encompassing mega vision of the 'metaverse' that promises to 'forever alter our daily lives, our work and how we think' (Ball, 2022: 12).

However, reality has fallen far behind these expectations as of yet. One reason for the lack of consumer interest has been the steep price of VR. For a long time, the HTC Vive has been the gold standard of VR gaming. At release, the headset alone came at 799€, a set of optional full-body tracking controllers are another 99€ each, where at least 3 trackers are needed for partial leg tracking, complementary to the head- and hand tracking provided by the headset and controller devices. On top of that, a capable mid-to-high end gaming PC is required which costs at least 1000€. This comes to an estimated total of 2000€ and at least rudimentary technical knowledge to use software that is often faulty and developed by small teams or hobbyists or unoptimized ports of existing non-VR exclusive software. For this reason, VR has for the longest time been considered a fringe hobby for enthusiasts rather than a mass market. This is in turn also a contributing factor to the lack of quality exclusive VR content produced by big software studios. One of the few notable exceptions being Half-Life: Alyx, developed by Valve.

Another earlier example of big-tech's investment into making VR accessible on a mass-scale is Google's 'Cardboard'. Cardboard is surprisingly low-tech solution to the problem of affordability of VR devices, coming from a tech-conglomerate such as Google. Cardboard is a simple foldable cardboard cutout sheet that can be assembled into a holding device for a smartphone. The phone can then play virtual reality experiences with an app that is available on the app-store. However, similarly developer enthusiasm as well as consumer interest for these app experiences has been low.

The Oculus Quest 2, released in 2020 by Meta, is a virtual reality headset that offers a middle ground between high-end VR devices such as the Valve Index or HTC Vive and low-tech solutions such as the Google Cardboard. The Quest 2 is priced at €299, making it relatively affordable compared to other VR devices. It also has the capability of running as a standalone device, which means that it can be operated without needing to connect an external PC to the device. The Quest 2 runs on an Android-based operating system with an internal CPU, that can be compared to a high-end smartphone. Although connecting a PC is still possible to utilize more powerful hardware, the standalone capability makes the Quest 2 much more affordable compared to other VR devices as most users lack a capable gaming PC and wouldn’t want to buy one just for VR.

Additionally, Meta offers their own app store for Quest 2 devices, where applications can be bought and sold like Google's Play Store or Apple's Appstore for smartphone devices. The apps on the platform are curated and their contents tightly controlled by Meta's API[[4]](#_ftn4).

The concept of Virtual Reality has been gaining concrete economic traction in recent years, with many tech giants investing heavily in its development.

# Three-Body-Interfacing[[5]](#_ftn5)

Setting up the Quest 2 headset for the very first time, i am prompted with setting up a 'playspace' - that is, to mark my surroundings in the physical world so that I will be warned whenever my physical body is nearing a wall within my room, which i would not realize when immersed into the digital world.

For this, I am in a so-called 'Passthrough' mode. In Passthrough, the image in the virtual reality headset is generated through two cameras in the front of the headset, filming the environment.

## Quest 2 environment

The passthrough mode of the Quest 2 results in a very distorted image. The camera quality is low, colors are black and white. Additionally, the two cameras on the front of the device are not at eye-level. To offset this, the image is artificially recalculated to appear at eye-level, resulting in a kind of blurry image and an uncanny level of depth that feels as though it should be correct but appears not-quite correct. When I tried to boop the snoot of my feline companion, I instead hit his forehead, almost his eye, with my index finger. This only added to his apparent irritation at his human who strapped some kind of white box around their face.

Passthrough mode is meant as a way to temporarily orient oneself in physical reality ‘passing through’ to virtual reality. So the developers must have figured that a very crude camera would be enough for this purpose alone.

Once I set up the play space, I had to register myself as a user of the Quest 2 platform. To do this, I have to hack in my personally identifiable details with the help of a virtual keyboard that hovers in front of me, onto a 2-dimensional screen within a 3-dimensional space. To press the keys on the keyboard, I have to utilize the two controllers that are in my physical hands. These controllers are projected into the digital environment to appear exactly where my physical hands are but at this stage, only these controllers are visible, no connected body or hands. Out of each controller extends a blue laser. When the laser hits an interactable object within the world, such as a key on the keyboard, it is highlighted to indicate that an interaction is possible. To confirm this interaction, I click the trigger button. So, to put in the details I can use only one finger for each hand.

After branding myself as a new user in the database of 'Meta' and connecting my Facebook account, I can for the first time create my own ‘Avatar’. The avatar creation functions similarly to Nintendo’s Mii system. Avatars look similar as well.

After completing the avatar creation process, I enter the Quest 2's initial virtual environment. It's commonly referred to as the home environment. In this virtual space, I find myself in a living area carved into a cliffside. The design is elaborate and quite spacious, with a dining area, a big couch and many types of furnishings and decor. I can move in this environment like I would normally, however I would quickly run out of physical space. However, I can also move by using teleportation mode. When I press the analog stick on the right controller forward, an arched laser appears from my hands as well as several blue dots that are strewn around the living quarters. When the laser hits one of these dots and I let go of the analog stick, I teleport to the location of the dot on the ground.

One thing that immediately catches my attention is the view outside the windows. It offers a wide panorama of a valley. However, I can't help but notice a distinct visual difference. The interior of the living space has depth and three-dimensionality, while the view beyond the windows seems flat, like a 2D image. Another thing I notice is a constant blurriness, which adds to the uncanniness of the experience. I think to myself that I feel like I am inside of a Playstation 1 game, which is the console generation I used to play as a child. So as uncanny as the experience is, it also feels strangely familiar.

While that is a very subjective feeling, there is a point to be made about a strange temporality of technological ‘progress’ that manifests in virtual reality technology. The Quest 2 feels in some way like a futuristic leap forward, while at the same time taking several steps back into nostalgic territory.

the blurriness, the simple polygonal shapes, the compressed textures, the 3D environments complemented by a 2D panorama image. From a development perspective, these are all techniques used to limit computing complexity for hardware limitations that were also common during the very first days of 3D gaming in the 1990s and early 2000s. These techniques evoke a sense of familiarity like I would imagine a person who grew up around the 1950s to 1960s would feel familiarity with a film that is played on a monochrome television.

Yet, at the same time, there is undeniable novelty in feeling embodied in a 3-Dimensional digital environment, rather than just seeing a representation of a 3D space on a 2D screen.

## PCVR Environment

After the initial setup, the first thing that I wanted to do, was set up the connection to my PC in order to utilize the full power of my desktop PC, which I had just upgraded with a brand-new CPU.

To do this, I connect a (not included) USB Link Cable to the headset and the PC. Then, I open up the ‘Quest Link’ App through the inworld menu.

Doing this sends me into an entirely new environment. I am transported from the colorful home environment to a new environment which is a blindgly white gridspace underneath me and another blindingly white gridspace above me with white empty space stretching as far as the eye can see directly in front of me. This monotonous whiteness immediately reminds me of modern depictions of Christian purgatory such as in the film ‘Bruce Almighty’ (2003), when Jim Carrey’s role dies and is greeted by Morgan Freeman playing God in an empty, white place.

Apart from the rather plain aesthetics, this change of scenery takes me back to another era of interface computing, stretching further back into a time before I made any memories. To the time of vast, empty (black) space before graphical user interfaces. Smooth space. Opening a different program within VR is a vastly different experience than opening another program on PC where modern operating systems will run the program in a separate window that can be displayed along many other separately running and displayed windows. Instead, each program in VR is an entirely different world with different interface aesthetics and architectural protocols that govern the world.

To enter VRChat, I have to open up a different app first. Because I have installed VRChat on ‘Steam’ I first have to open ‘SteamVR’. Doing this, sends me to yet another separate environment. This time, we are in a blocky building that feels somewhere between industrial and startup chique, adorned with not much décor but a big screen that serves as the interface and a big (representation of an) analog clock on the wall.  Outside there is a nicer looking garden and yet another 2D panorama image to convey the illusion of vastness.

Now, we can finally start playing VRChat – or so I thought. After the initial setup, I find myself in yet another home environment. A rather dark, spacious room with a lot of décor, couches, a mirror and many portals that would take me to other worlds. After completing the basic tutorial, I encountered the first barrier that decides on the usability of VR for many users. The dreaded motion sickness. Moving forward in a single motion within the space of VR, while the physical body stands still, creates a dissonance in my brain that makes me lose my footing and makes me almost fall over. There are accessibility options, like narrowing the vision while moving – which does help the dissonance – or moving with the teleport function that we have already seen in the Quest 2 home environment. But stubborn as I am, I am trying to brute force the process of acclimatization, moving around even more, even faster in a circle around the room. This results in me feeling nauseous, so I have to take a short break.

Motion sickness is probably one of the biggest accessibility problems for mass adoption of VR technologies. According to medical literature, most first-time users of VR experience motion sickness, though it depends on the constitution of the human-hardware-software environment. Evidence suggests that motion sickness is related to fear and other negative emotions, which is tied to the kind of VR environment that is being used. With a horror environment triggering more motion sickness than a peaceful environment (Chattha et. Al., 2020). Additionally, past experience with moving in 3D environments (on a 2D screen) lowers the risk of experiencing motion sickness. So, motion sickness is a complex phenomenon that depends on many systematic factors from the individual constitution of the human user to the kind of program that is being used. The evidence for motion sickness suggests that it is closely related to rejection- or acceptance of virtual reality by the individual’s mind-body schema. In this sense, Virtual Reality could be compared to a cybernetic implant or a transplanted organ, which can be rejected or accepted by the immune system of a body. This is an important aspect of inequal access inherent to the technology and a further differentiator in the dangerous computer literacy skills gap that is already apparent in wider society.

After picking up where I left off and moving around again, the dizziness when moving around inworld has already subsided significantly. It seems to me that my attempt at brute forcing the acclimatization process has been successful for my particular body. However, soon afterwards another form of cybersickness complicates the interfacing process. One that originates not from the human mind-body system in reaction to the cybernetic systems but from the PCs organ control system in the form of it’s firmware. As I am trying out drawing in 3 Dimensions for the first time within VRChat, my experience of wonder was interrupted by an experience that anyone familiar with digital worlds will know and dread: CRASH.  
The world around me suddenly stops, none of my inputs are registered anymore. It is as though I am paralyzed. My vision is irritated by a small but noticable quickly flickering, colorful distortion. I try to move my head and turn, but I quickly realize that the system has completely froze. As I turn my head, the image of the digital environment behind me is not calculated and displayed anymore. Instead, the abyss stares back into me as reality seems as though it is sucked into a vortex. The flickering glitch extends to encompass my whole vision. What was a mild irritation is now a quite painful visual overstimulation that makes me yank the headset off my head. I have to sit down. Looking at my PC, I realize that it has experienced a Blue Screen of Death. Once, a threateningly cryptic wall of hieroglyphic text with an offensively blue background greeted a user when the PC encountered a critical error, forcing a reboot. The developers of more recent versions of windows opted to instead keep the technical documentation brief and display a sympathetic ‘:(‘ emoticon. I am thankful for this addition as I would not have needed the added stress in that moment.

This error would appear regularly until I figured out that it was a faulty graphics card driver. Reverting the driver back to an older version has fixed the issue.

What is particularly striking was that the experience of glitch in VR haunts me even beyond the time I have a headset on my face. Since that day, I regularly experience a very particular non-painful sensation around what feels like my frontal cortex when I am in bed and about to doze off into sleep. It’s an experience that my mind associates with memories of lag within VR, which I have not experienced before or after in any other context. It’s neither painful nor particularly irritating and is over very quickly. While this experience cannot be viewed as indicative for any long-term dangers, it certainly is indicative that the process of interfacing with VR results in – broadly speaking - systematic changes in the informational structure of the cybernetic devices interfacing with each other. This includes the human brain. Like the Graphics card firmware has been rewired to accommodate the Quest 2 device, so too has my human brain been rewired to accommodate the entirely new experience of moving while standing still. Along with a mildly traumatic memory caused by the visual overstimulation of experiencing a glitch while immersed in VR.

This description of my process of interfacing with VR technology was of course very individually subjective and personal. My experience may differ greatly from other people’s experience, and it may or may not be representative of a typical experience. However, one thing seems certain: Interfacing with virtual reality has many similarities to familiar paradigms of technology but takes them to a different dimension. Quite Literally. When speaking of a program’s environment back then, it was a more abstract idea. In VR, one is literally immersed in a program as an environment which the brain may register as an embodied experience – reacting much more viscerally to it. As of yet, there are many things that can go wrong when one is interfacing with VR technology. It is very much still an experimental technology. Many PC configurations are incompatible with it as standards for different systems have not yet been developed. It’s the same with body configurations. Many bodies are simply ill equipped and/or unwilling to handle the not unsubstantial physical and mental load of interfacing with VR technology. This remains a very important barrier of entry towards VR technology, rendering it a rather elitist technology rather than one that could help everyone equally, now in 2023. Considering the heightened power, a developer of VR technology has over it’s human user, it is all the more important to make sure that VR technology is accessible to as broad a spectrum of people as possible. Technology developers must remain accountable to the public in their design choices.

As early as 1930, Sigmund Freud identified the condition of the modern human as that of a ‘Prosthetic God’ who is “quite grand, when he equips all his helping organs, but they’re not quite fused with him and as of yet give him many problems” (Freud, 1930: 24). Nearly 100 years later, we can see how the process of fusion with machines takes shape as we always have access to brain-extending information machines in our pockets, in our homes and offices. Though the gods are not equal. And the problems that come along with technological development don’t show any signs of subsiding.

When Freud wrote about the prosthetic God and Haraway wrote about the Cyborg, I wonder if they could have envisioned a figure that looked similar to how my body looks when it has the magical blindfold strapped to the head, tethered to a whirring brain-machine, strange devices in hand, casting runic incantations into the air.

Though I doubt these minds of the 20th century could have imagined that these strange ritualistic objects are not prosthetics for the purpose of manipulating the physical world but one for transporting oneself to a world that is entirely different from ‘meatspace’. A world of ghosted corporeality. A world of the Avatar.  
If the human meat body is the first body and the hardware tethered to the first body – be that a shovel or a VR Headset – is the second body. Then, perhaps the avatar that can interact with a digital world, constitutes a third body.

# VRChat - Smooth Bodies in a striated place

Before beginning this research, I was faced with the question if VRChat could even be considered a viable research object for a seminar about digital gaming communities.

In 2008, Anthropologist Tom Boellstorff had laid important groundwork for the study of what would come to be called the ‘virtually human’ in his ethnography ‘Coming of Age in Second Life’. Second life is characterized by a great amount of freedom and was never really marketed as a ‘game’ but, as the rather grandiose name suggests, as an extension of a person’s real life with its own virtual economy based on real world money. I remember the early days of second life myself and the big hype surrounding it in mainstream media, specifically around older individuals. During this hype phase, even big brands such as Nike would set up shop in Second Life to sell virtual shoes[[6]](#_ftn6). Though the public interest very quickly subsided along with the interest of big capital.

Closely following in 2010, Anthropologist Bonnie Nardi took a deep dive into the Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game ‘World of Warcraft’. In her book ‘My Life as a Night Elf Priest’, she looked at a virtual world that is similar, yet very different to second life. World of Warcraft is very clearly a game and never pretended to be anything but. While mainstream media looked at WoW with much suspicion and moral panic, it’s cultural and economic impact as well as longevity has arguably been much greater than second life’s.[[7]](#_ftn7) the often cited reason for it’s success has been it’s relative accessibility. Although the game is subscription based, Nardi describes the cost as very low compared to real world performative activities (p. 54). Another aspect of accessibility is that the game has always been quite performative on many systems. Especially during release, the game design for world of warcraft has been cited as more accessible, compared to many other MMOs of the time. The gameplay loop being straightforward and intuitive while many other MMOs of the time did a poor job of explaining it’s many rather complex mechanics.

Like Second Life, VRChat is not a ‘game’ in the classic sense. It is more a social platform, where people can interact with each other using community-crafted Avatars and worlds by the users of VRChat for the users of VRChat. Worlds can be simple hangouts as well as many kinds of games. From kart-racing, bowling, pool, shooters. Even a relatively complex fighter jet simulation game come to mind. So, VRChat is first and foremost a platform. But one where play as a community activity is very much possible and encouraged.  
In terms of hardware accessibility, VRChat is very accessible. Contrary to the name, VRChat does not require VR to play and can be started with only a PC. Even a client for smartphones is being developed and currently in Alpha. In terms of VR, VRChat can be played with both PCVR and the Quest2 standalone system. If one has access to it, VRChat also supports full body tracking capabilities.  
On the contrary to second life, digital objects generally do not cost money. In VRChat, there is no purchasable virtual currency that is tied to an actual currency. Although it is still possible and not actively discouraged to make real life money with virtual objects, as Avatars and worlds can be closed from being copied ingame, instead exchanged for money using third party platforms[[8]](#_ftn8). But the program itself is completely free. No basic functionalities of VRChat are gated behind a paywall. VRChat supports itself financially through a cheap premium subscription model and investors. This model is specifically for ‘supporters’, indicating that VRChat does not really see itself as a product that has to turn profit[[9]](#_ftn9), but rather as a community project that is communally owned and has running costs to cover. Interestingly, they also mention on the subscription FAQ that the long-term goal for VRChat is to ‘let creators support themselves’[[10]](#_ftn10) hinting at self-sustaining an inworld economy like second life.  
Currently, the only benefits for paying the 9,99$ per month for the VRChat Plus subscription, are: Visual differentiators such as a custom nameplate, the ability to send pictures with written chat and 3D profile backgrounds. Additionally, there are two functions one may consider ‘pay to win’, if there was such a thing as ‘winning’ VRChat. There is an increase in Avatar ‘inventory’ space to up to 300. And there is an instant boost in ‘Trust’-rank. This function requires explaining, as it is quite unique.

The trust rank[[11]](#_ftn11) is described as a safety feature, ranking users from the lowest visitor to new user, user, known user, trusted user and friend. Additionally, there is a negative rank called ‘nuisance’. The trust ranks can be ‘levelled’ by using VRChat, making friends and uploading content (or by paying the subscription fee). However, becoming the highest rank ‘friend’ is simply a question of actively adding someone to the friends list, indicating that a user trusts another user.

Interestingly, the trust rank governs avatar functionalities. So, a new user will have the functions voice, avatar and particles / lights activated but audio (custom audio files played by the avatar), shaders (custom graphics code – users might deploy visual effects that could trigger discomfort or use bloated graphics code that may trigger a system crash) and custom animations will be deactivated. A ‘nuisance’ will have all avatar functionalities disabled (which makes them essentially imperceivable).

So, VRChat strikes the delicate balance between allowing users as much creative freedom as possible and minimizing griefing by deploying a trust rank and layering avatar functionalities, allowing the system to control users’ virtual body capabilities by (de-)activating individual functionalities.  
If the third eye is the mind and thought, characterized through the ultimate freedom and independence of being untouchable and unique to the individual, thought of as immune to any sort of biopolitical repression apart from death – then the third body is strangely the opposite of that. The virtual human is a being of pure data, necessarily at the complete and utter mercy of the gods of the platform in which the third body resides. This might seem a bit pathetic considering one could simply ‘move on’ from a game, as many would suggest, or simply not misbehave, as others may suggest. Though considering the very real possibility and ambition of spaces such as VRChat (or other ‘Metaverse’ spaces) of becoming self-sustaining, inter-operable economies with livelihoods attached to it, systems of bio-hardware control are very important to keep a close eye on.

  

## Noisy Bodies

Moving through VRChat with the Quest 2 standalone system is at first glance not a very different experience to PCVR. The home environment is already not a very graphically complex environment, and the standard avatars are all also simple. When I first ventured out into the world and tried to access different worlds however, I quickly realized that VRChat is a much more class-based society than I previously thought. Each world is marked with a blue circle for ‘PC’ and/or a green circle for ‘Quest’. On PC, I saw quite a few worlds that are only accessible through PC. On Quest, those worlds are not visible at all. This hardware-apartheid has been implemented to deal with the inequality inherent to hardware’s computing capabilities. The Quest 2 standalone system has much less computing power than a VR system that is connected to a desktop PC. Most content on VRChat is user-created. So, it would impact user freedom quite a lot if the API would enforce all worlds to be optimized and simplified to run on the Quest 2 hardware. At the same time however, user freedom impacts accessibility. The Quest 2 being a much more accessible system, many users are barred from accessing certain content.

The Youtube Channel ‘Humans of VR’ has made a video, interviewing VRChat users about this topic.[[12]](#_ftn12) Apparently, stigma against quest 2 users is a prolific cultural phenomenon on the platform. The biggest cited reason for stigmatizing Quest 2 users is the accessibility and affordability itself, as it allows more children to enter the platform whose behavior is seen as loud and annoying by adult users. However, the stigma leads even adult quest 2 users to being preemptively blocked and looked down upon.

As I enter my first world – the ‘black cat club’ – I quickly realize another downside to being a user of the standalone Quest 2 system. The standard body that is displayed for other users is a formation of blue crystals in a roughly humanoid shape. This shape will be displayed as a placeholder model if the avatar of a person is not yet loaded. As I enter, most shapes I see are these blue crystals. I approach a group of people who stand together in front of a mirror, talking over voice chat. As I come closer, a blue bar appears over some of their nameplates. 20/120 MB. The data of the avatar is being downloaded onto my system as I approach the avatars. All of the avatars in the group are being downloaded. To display the whole group of people, about 500MB of data space has been occupied on the drive of my Quest 2. That is quite a lot of data for one group of people considering that I will download many more avatars as I walk through the lands and perceive the third body of people. As mentioned above, the cheapest version of the quest 2 comes with a mere 128GB of storage space, so storage conservation is a real concern for these users. I am not sure how the storage of data works within VRChat – if the avatar data is cached and deleted automatically after a while to save up space. But this constitutes another stressor for the human-hardware assemblage. Additionally, loading avatars by default can be toggled off as an option.

Looking at the ‘trending’ tab in the worlds section, a very peculiar world picks my interest. One of the most populated worlds, with over 300 users, is one with the simple name ‘1’s optimized Box’. And the title is no clickbait, the map is literally just a box that is optimized for using as little computing power as possible. Upon entering the world, I see a big, cube shaped white room adorned with nothing but black lines that form a gridspace, much like the PCVR home environment from earlier. Immediately in front of me are two cube shaped objects, one in blue and one in white. Clicking on the blue box changes the environment color to blue. In the distance, I see a bunch of players standing on the other side of the room, staring at the wall. Some walking / jumping around. After they loaded in, I see that many avatars vary drastically in size too. Some being tiny creatures, some huge. Most have come together in smaller separate groups, talking to each other over voice-chat. As I approach the walls, I see some additional square shaped buttons. Clicking the button reveals that the walls act as a mirror, which explains why all the users were staring at the wall.

Conserving computing power is a very real concern for users with less powerful systems, as lag is a common occurrence. Especially considering that most avatars and worlds are user-created, with many being poorly optimized. Noise and sensory overload is an all-encompassing phenomenon of the digital world. Algorithms trivialize the production of information, or noise. There is a relaxing simplicity to a space or a body that does not have much going on. That has simple shapes, inoffensive lighting, displaying something familiar like a Pokémon or a polygonal videogame character, like an N64 model of Link from the legend of Zelda or a Chibi style anime character. A model that minimizes the information a recipient brain has to parse might be compared to a simple, casual outfit. It does not stand out and is easy to relate to.

## Cyborg Erotica

Done with my field research for the day, I want to check how VRChat is received over live streams on Twitch.TV, if at all. To my only mild surprise, I find many streams with the VRChat tag. At the time I was checking, most of them were following a similar formula. The streamer is filming their avatar with a separate inworld camera, not their first person VR view. Almost all of the avatars have a feminine, very curvy shape, wearing sexually provocative clothing. Music is running in the background. Utilizing full-body motion tracking they are dancing and playing around with the camera to show different angles of their body. Most have some kind of anthropomorphic animal shape. Some being fully ‘furry’ avatars, some mostly human shaped with animal features such as tails or cat ears. Many are not talking at all, instead (apparently) utilizing a speech-to-text system to communicate with chat via text communication. Others utilize a robot voice in a speech-to-text-to-speech system.  
So called ‘Mutes’ are common in VRChat. They are users who don’t talk, instead using mostly the emotive body-language capabilities of their avatars to communicate.

Many streamers do talk though. A common conversation topic is the placement of the full body trackers and weird glitches that may happen due to faulty calibration. Showing off different avatars and their capabilities, discussing camera angles, details of the room and backgrounds. Many of them are sex workers who sell more explicit content on different sites.

Earlier, I alluded to the casual, compressed avatar and space. Naturally, cyborg sex workers deploy quite elaborate bodies with many details and effects. Beauty in the cyberworld does not follow a standard model. What is considered perfect conventional beauty in the western media world, would be considered quite boring in VRChat. There is software to create almost photorealistic simulations of a human body that is free and relatively easy to use, such as the program ‘Metahuman’. However, you would scarcely see these metahuman representations of a human on VRChat. Avatars that are considered ‘premium’, that is, that people pay money for, are not at all ‘realistic’ representations. They are elaborate in style and fantastical. With many accessories, tattoos, details. Alternative styles like goth, furry, anime, flaunting and playing into an ‘artificial’, stylized 3D look, instead of going for Photorealism. Avatar beauty in VRChat means as much individuality as possible. After all, standardized bodies are easily copyable. Avatars that are elaborate, complex assemblages are exclusive. They involve quite a lot of skilled specialized labor. From the 3D art of the individual body parts and accessories, texturing, animations, gestures, shaders to rigging so that VR movement translates into fluid Avatar motions.

Often, VRChat sex workers will describe their ‘Setup’ in the profile. That is, their headset, controller, and full body motion capture set. Some (though not on twitch) may even have sex toys that are operable over the internet, allowing customers to evoke a real reaction from the streamer. Again, VR technology is not only technology for immersing oneself visually in a 3D environment. It is cybernetic technology that allows for a feedback process. The more cybernetic hardware a person has, the better their immersive experience and the greater their range of expression through the Avatar will be.

On the surface, cyborg erotica could mean hypersexualized bodies that are stylized idealizations of the feminine form and fetishization of objects for producing images. However, we should look closer at these cyborgs and shed our impulse to judge them through a lense that privileges an essentialized form of the natural human body. Through the human-hardware assemblage, we can see how desire does not merely reside in the representation of an essential ideal of the masculine/feminine body. Cyborg desire should be read through the cyborg body. Cyborg beauty means aesthetic uniqueness, sympathetic expression, technical capability, visual quality through computational capacity and rich cybernetic equipment to allow for feedback and resonance. The cyborg neither privileges the first ‘natural’ body nor fetishizes the digitally produced image but desires the whole human-hardware assemblage.

# Conclusions

In addressing the original research question about the accessibility of VR technology and VR spaces, this paper has deployed the concepts of machinic assemblage and cyborg ontology to describe the challenges and dis/continuities in the ongoing process of becoming-post-human. One could assume that the world of the ‘Avatar’ would be an equalizer as the inequalities of biology and socioeconomic means are rendered irrelevant. However, it does not look like this is fully the case.

Much like the first body, the third body is an assemblage that embodies its social standing. Fashion and looks are a differentiator for social status. In the digital world, this is also the case as more technically and aesthetically elaborate expressions of individuality for the avatar are becoming commodities to be bought and sold. Within games studies, this phenomenon is known as cosmetic microtransactions which are characterized by being designed and sold centrally by the developers of a digital environment. However, within VRChat these digital commodities are created and sold by users themselves, introducing more free market principles into the digital economy. Making Avatars and Avatar accessories is a complicated technical skill, but one that can be learned by most people.

Avatars within VRChat have a very high potential for expression that almost mirrors the first body in some ways and even exceeds the possibilities for expression in other ways. This makes the production of real time performative services possible. However, range of expression is gated behind the hardware capabilities of users as complex avatars and worlds require powerful computing hardware as well as additional sensors for motion capturing.

The process of interfacing the first body with the second body to become the third body is also one that is not equally accessible. Beyond the monetary cost, VR technologies require a high amount of acclimatization of the body-mind schema. People without prior experience with digital technologies may be further left behind in the ongoing process of digitization as VR becomes more relevant for economic participation. Motion sickness and sensitivities to sensory input, such as with epilepsy, has been a known phenomenon for as long as digital environments existed. VR technology seems to exacerbate the problems as receiving digital information through one screen for each eye means that the amount of sensory information that is transmitted to the eye is also multiplied. More medical research is needed to properly analyze this phenomenon and develop solutions to improve conditions for accessibility as well as safety.

This exploration of VR has shown that the Avatar as the third body is still inextricably tied to the biopolitical and socioeconomic condition of the first body as well as the power of big capital that controls these conditions. Materialism implores us to not neglect the inherent inequalities in material conditions.

However, the avatar that is produced by and performed within the human-hardware assemblage troubles the normative assumptions of the human condition. The material that makes up the avatar is computer code. Sets of instruction for the human-hardware assemblage. Computer code is a material that is much more malleable than DNA as the code that governs the structure of the human body. Code (so long as it is open source) allows for free tinkering, experimentation and play with body and spatial configurations. However, this freedom exists in a tense relationship with accessibility and equality. Cybernetic technologies such as VR are materials that cost money to buy and take skill to properly operate. Standardization of cybernetic technologies increases accessibility but also often means less computational capability, closed source code and tighter control as increased accessibility simultaneously means that more vulnerable users are entering a space.

VRChat is an example of a community that has formed in a digital environment through the activity of play. Not play with a centrally designed ludic system but play with their own human-hardware bodies, carving functional and symbolically meaningful spaces out of the material of code. VRChat as a platform deploys interesting ways to reconciliate the freedom of letting users create and share their own content with accessibility for as many users as possible. VR technology and VR social spaces as well as games offer many interesting vantage points for games studies as well as new materialist body studies and science and technology studies.

[[7]](#_ftnref7) NOTE: One could take this very interesting dichotomy to many different directions. One place would be the inherent tension in the design concepts between second life and world of warcraft, which can be characterized through the deleuzian spatial concept of the smooth and the striated. In deleuzian terms, smooth space is space such as the ocean or a desert. Flat, lawless and free. Where the greatest danger is getting lost in it’s vastness. It’s inhabitants nomadic and constantly on the move. Striated space is space such as a forest or a city. Many laws and rules govern the space. Each corner is saturated with sedentary creatures who carve out territories for themselves. In terms of game design, this spatial concept characterizes the tension between over- and underdesigning a game. Especially in MMORPGs, this tension surfaces as ‚Sandbox‘ MMOs versus ‘Theme-Park’ MMOs. One being characterized with a great amount of freedom and little ‘handholding’, the other characterized by a very actively designed and tightly gated gaming experience. For more see: Cremin, 2016.
