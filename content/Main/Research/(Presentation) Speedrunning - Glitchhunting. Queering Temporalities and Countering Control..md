The basic plot of the film is that the protagonist ‚NEO‘ comes to know that the world around him is a simulation to obfuscate the reality that an alien race is harvesting human bodies for their energy.

Mr. Anderson is transitioning to ‚NEO‘, slowly leaving his old identity behind as he comes to terms with this reality, even actively choosing to take a ‚red pill‘ to continue on his journey of truth and adversariality instead of taking a ‚blue pill‘ that would send him back to the comfortable simulated world

The main antagonist, Agent Smith, is a sort of beaurocrat or cop of the Matrix. Agent Smith is also the only one to consistently ‚Deadname‘ Neo, that is, to call him Mr. Anderson, the name assigned to NEO by the Matrix. Not unlike a trans person discovering that their assigned gender within the heterosexual Matrix, to use a concept from Judith Butler‘s book ‚Gender Trouble‘, that released in the same year as the film, is merely a simulated construct that can be overcome, even though agents of this heterosexual matrix will continuously try and push them back into their assigned function or into their death.

To quote Lana & Lilly Wachowski: „What we were trying to ‚get at the inexplicable nature of the universe that is in constant dialogue with our own consciousness and our consciousness actually affects the inexplicable nature of the universe.“

So, through the film they are exploring concepts of constructivism.

Meanwhile, there are people who explore and manipulate virtual worlds in a similar way: People who do Speedrunning.

So, speedrunners reappropriate the systems of the human-made worlds that they are navigating to get to the end much quicker than anyone could through Glitches. Glitches are these errors. They‘re unexpected interactions or inputs that lead to unexpected outcomes.

In this video, I will show you what that looks like.

The video is by Narcissa Wright, who was then known as Cosmo. She‘s performing at AGDQ, a regular charity speedrunning event. The game she‘s playing is The Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time. This demonstration will be a lot more powerful if you know the game, but i hope that if you don‘t know it, you can still have some notion of what‘s going on.

Start: 14:15

Demonstration des Glitches: Ende bei 16:20 <2 Min>

It looks very confusing, but Narcissa performed some very complex, very precise and meticulously planned-out actions here to trigger an error that sends her from the very beginning of the game to the very end of the game that would take at the very least 6 hours to complete at a normal pace.

If you‘re interested, she explains the technical side of how this glitch works a bit directly after i paused here.

Slide 5

I had a short chat with Narcissa Wright about her own experiences of the intersections of being transgender and glitching videogames. It was unfortunately very short and with a lot of room for interpretation but This what she had to say:

I found this unprompted interpretation of games as ‚User Experience‘ and, similarly, transgender living and life in general as ‚user experience‘ really interesting. ‚It presupposes that the social world and it‘s constructs like gender are functionally designed, informational systems. In this view of the world, Humans/People/Citizens are ‚Users‘ of

The structures of control that govern bodies gendered identities as iterative, programmed systems that have a certain intended temporality as well as boundaries of movement, pre-defined goals and certain steps one has to complete to get to these goals. A designed experience of being woman, being man, with being transgender as an in-between process of transition.

Crucially, a speedrunner is a ‚user‘ of a videogame that reappropriates the intended use-cases of the system – not a ‚hacker‘ that simply recodes the game. But a user that acts within the bounds of the system and finds errors within the system itself, not from the outside as some sort of god-like being.

Similarly, a citizen might be a ‚user‘ of structures of control, but a single user can never just rewrite the code the systems are constructed with. They may glitch those systems though, through subversive actions that uncover the contradictions within the code. Through the performance of queerness that destabilize the intended systems of the heterosexual Matrix. Like Narcissa performed queer dances in the digital world of the legend of zelda to trigger errors that subvert the intended user experience.

Slide 6

As Narcissa also explained in the video, the performance of these queer dances that trigger errors are a processes of collective learning. The glitch she performed to skip from the beginning dungeon directly to the end of the game took 13 years to discover. 13 years of thousands of people looking through every nook and cranny of the game world, trying out every combination of possible interactions with the world. Of reverse engineering the intrinsic logic that was used to construct the game world by the original developers of the game to find the errors to trigger and to appropriate for the purpose of speedrunning.

The glitch hunters are scientists. Physicists, astronomers of a human-engineered world, trying to understand the intricacies of it‘s mechanics.

One glitch that that may be performed in the process of learning the internal logic of a game is to take a peak ‚behind the curtain‘ – to see through the walls. If we see through the walls, we see a whole lot of nothing. Empty space. The virtual empty space through which the reality of the videogame is actualized as the player moves through space. To peak behind the wall in a game is to take a peak into that which is not meant to be seen from that angle, in that time, in that space. That which is not yet loaded for the player to see. That which is not yet meant to be.

The peak behind the wall allows for a peak at the mechanisms and logics that construct the world, like in the illustration of Flammarion.

Like the glitchhunters seek to understand the systems to reappropriate them, so do marginalized actors – users – of social structures.

When I saw the wall glitch I had to think of Sara Ahmed‘s book ‚Complaint‘ and her metaphor of the wall within institutions that are put in place as hurdles for marginalized people.

Ahmed describes the complaint as a process of diversity & Inclusion work to slowly chip away at these walls, as a form of feminist pedagogy to ultimately create a more inclusive institution. Perhaps as a feedback process to slowly recode the institution?

BUT, what if we take this metaphor and take a peak behind the wall, perhaps even glitch the bounds and move behind these walls instead of chipping away at them? To sequence break the hurdles that are put in place for marginalized people. Is it possible?

[Sara Ahmed: The Wall.

-Chipping away at the wall. Or peering behind it?

-Reverse-Engineering the code through which systems of inequality are constructed.]

-

Complaining that the system is not fair – it is not intended to be fair. It is meant – intended - to control.

Slide 7

I would argue that K., a trans person I got to know intimately, did just that.

The Context here is that K was trying to get approved for hormone-replacement therapy and went to multiple doctors to try and get a prescription.

The glitch is the contradiction between not letting harm come to K as a patient. Through the action of ordering hormones off the internet, the doctor was signalled that K really means it and will not be swayed in their decision..

Also it means that there is now a contradiction. In the doctor‘s code, K is ‚cis‘ so lang as K has not been ‚proven‘ to be trans, that is to have gender dysphoria, by a psychologist. A process that usually takes at least a year of intrusive therapy. This means that the doctor will not approve gender affirming care because HRT would mean interfering with a ‚healthy‘ body, nevermind K‘s self-reported gender dysphoria.

Since K ordered hormones off the internet, there is now a contradiction though. Because the danger of K taking unadministered hormones far supercedes the dangers of an ‚interference in the healthy body‘. Following this logic, the doctor can now start gender-affirming care for K.

![[Pasted image 20240329201619.png]]
Slide 8

K studied the intrinsic logic of the medical institutions, the law and the doctor‘s psychological profile to calculate an approach to getting what K needed and to alleviate their gender dysphoria. Not unlike a speedrunner studies the game‘s intrinsic logic to find errors to be exploited to complete the game faster.

K reported extreme distress at the thought of having to go through potentially degrading and intrusive forced therapy, but the doctor would not give the prescription until the hormones K ordered off the internet changed the circumstances. It was, it was a matter of logic, of the code within the medical institution that renders the doctor an agent of the biopolitical dispositives and K. as a body subjected to the biopolitical regimes.

The circumstances were, that K was a disidentified body in a medical institution in which bodies are categorized machinic assemblages. A body that was in a liminal state between ‚sick‘ and ‚healthy‘, between ‚man‘ and ‚woman‘ even between ‚trans‘ and ‚cis‘. K‘s state of disidentification triggers a state of uncertainty. A preliminary state as the medical machine restructures itself to construct new categories, because that is how the machine operates. A dangerous state for the disidentified body, as it is uncertain whether the categorization will be favourable or not for them.

But, crucially, also a state of potential for the disidentified body to take active control over which category one is ordered within for a more favourable outcome.

In this case, K signalled they really ‚meant it‘ and that they were willing to be cooperative, yet also desperate and reckless enough to take an unknown substance. This signalled the doctor that K ‚really meant it‘ and gave them the confidence to proceed without a psychologist‘s opinion.

I would argue that K‘s speedrun of the medical system is an example of a marginalized person glitching a wall that was put in place for them to be dissuaded of using or accessing an institutional service. This glitching constitutes a practice of survival for people who disidentify with their assigned categories of being.

In their Glitch Feminist Manifesto, Legacy Russel extends Simone De Beauvoirs notion of ‚one is not born a woman, but rather becomes a woman to ‚one is not born, but rather becomes a body‘. This becoming of body recognizes an in-between state of uncertainty. A glitched body is a transgender body at the beginning of transition, a non-binary body, a mixed body, a body between socioeconomic strata.

A body without preconfigured notions of being, without intended function. A body told to ‚decide‘, but never really able to stay fixed and is instead locked in a constant state of in-between.

To quote Russel again: Glitch Feminism forces us to confront the violence that society  has done to bodies who choose to disidentify, to bodies that exist in the liminal and embrace the in-between as a core component of survival, of utility and to seek out opportunity to trigger errors in this flawed system.

 I want to explore exactly these survival techniques of the glitched bodies and how they trigger errors in the flawed system, drawing upon the collective wisdom of the speedrunning community who hunt glitches for sport. To identify the practices of the disidentified people as glitchhunting and to maybe also collaboratively hunt for glitches in the matrix of the ‚real world‘ that make survival for disidentified bodies a bit more easy.
